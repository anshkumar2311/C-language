# 3D Healthcare Chat Interface - Design Prompt

## Design Philosophy
Create a futuristic yet approachable medical interface that combines 3D elements with practical functionality. The design should feel cutting-edge while maintaining medical credibility.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- Primary: 
  - Medical Blue (#2B4CCF) - For primary actions and key elements
  - Healing Green (#36B37E) - For success states and progress indicators
  - Pure White (#FFFFFF) - For backgrounds and text
- Secondary:
  - Warm Gray (#F7F9FC) - For cards and containers
  - Alert Red (#FF5630) - For warnings and emergencies
- Gradients:
  - Blue to Purple: `linear-gradient(45deg, #2B4CCF, #7B61FF)`
  - Green to Blue: `linear-gradient(45deg, #36B37E, #2B4CCF)`
